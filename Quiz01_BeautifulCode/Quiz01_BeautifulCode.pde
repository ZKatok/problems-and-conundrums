This sketch is not meant to be run; it simply describes what should be included 
in a sketch that would be considered "beautiful code."

// the programmer should declare (and, if applicable, define) any variables here, before the setup and draw functions.
// variables should be well-named in order to make the code easy to read.

void setup() { // the setup function is where the programmer should put anything that happens when the code is first run.
  size(/* use two parameters to establish height and width of view screen */);
  // other things that might go in setup include initial background color and initial shapes.
}

void draw() { // the draw function is where the programmer should put anything that needs to be run over and over throughout the running of the program. This is useful for animation and interaction.
  // common elements in the draw function are if, when, and for loops.
  // anything that involves changing a variable should also go here
}


// Throughout the whole sketch, remember to write many concise comments that accurately describe what you're doing in each section of the code.
// Also remember to keep formatting clear; this can be easily achieved by command-t, the auto-format command.
